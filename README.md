# LinAl
This repository contains the codes for Linear Algebra Algorithms and operations.

Plan is to include:
1. Determinant of a Matrix :heavy_check_mark:
2. Inverse of a Matrix :hourglass_flowing_sand:
3. Solving a system of Linear Equeations :hourglass_flowing_sand:
4. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) :hourglass_flowing_sand:
