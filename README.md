# LinAl
This repository contains the codes for Linear Algebra Algorithms and operations.
The current work contains:
1. Determinant of a Matrix

Further plan is to include:
~~1. Determinant of a Matrix~~
2. Inverse of a Matrix
3. Solving a system of Linear Equeations
4. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
